# Setup for code
1. Install IntelliJ Idea or other IDE                                                                                                                  
Link to download: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows        
                                                                                                                  2. Install Tomcat 9.0 or have an open source web server that hosts Java- based web applications 
                                                                                                                  3. To run code on IntelliJ IDE make sure tomcat is connected to the run/debug configurations 
                                                                                                                  4. Clone Repository 
# Running the code
1. Once all files are downloaded onto IDE and are ready, run the code
                                                                                                                   2. A website should pop up showing the main page (you can find the code for this under Webapp file, named index.jsp)
                                                                                                                   3. Once the website pops up it will show you three buttons all labelled with where they will take you.
4. The adopt button will take you to a page that shows you a list of animals you can select and see a more in depth view of
5. If you go back to the home page using the back arrow and select the shop button it is a very similar looking page to the adopt page. It shows you items you can select to also see a more detailed view of.
6. Going back to the homepage and selecting the playdate button will bring you to a page that allows you to view events in the area for your pets
